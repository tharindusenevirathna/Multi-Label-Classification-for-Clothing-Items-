# Multi-Label Classification for Clothing Items

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to assist a retail company in optimizing their marketing campaign by developing a deep learning model to classify images of clothing items into 10 distinct categories. Accurate classification of fashion items can streamline inventory management, enhance customer experience, and enable targeted marketing strategies. We use TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning library, to build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of performing multi-label classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Objective

- **Develop a Robust Classification Model**: Build a neural network to accurately classify clothing images into 10 categories using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **Optimize Model Performance**: Implement regularization techniques and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's accuracy and generalization.
- **Analyze Model Predictions**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset, visualize correct and incorrect classifications, and gain insights into the modelâ€™s behavior.

## Dataset

The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of:
- **60,000 training images**: Grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, representing 10 different categories such as T-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, and ankle boot.
- **10,000 test images**: Used for evaluating the model's performance.

Each image is associated with a label from one of the 10 categories. This dataset serves as a more challenging alternative to the traditional MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Load the Dataset**: Load the Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
- **Preprocess the Data**: Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 and reshape the images to include a single channel for grayscale representation.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert the labels into one-hot encoded vectors to prepare for multi-class classification.

### 2. Model Design

#### Baseline CNN Model
- **Build a Baseline Model**: A simple convolutional neural network with several layers:
  - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
  - Max-pooling layers for downsampling.
  - Dense layers for classification.
- **Compile and Train**: Use categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer to compile the model and evaluate its performance on the test set.

#### Enhanced CNN Model
- **Regularization Techniques**: Introduce dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Batch Normalization**: Add batch normalization layers to stabilize and accelerate training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search or manual tuning to optimize hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

- **Training**: Train the model using the training set with a validation split to monitor performance on unseen data.
- **Early Stopping**: Use early stopping or a learning rate scheduler to avoid overfitting and improve convergence.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the test set and record performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Training History Visualization**: Visualize trends in loss and accuracy over epochs to analyze model performance.

### 4. Model Analysis

- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyze the confusion matrix to identify which classes are most frequently misclassified.
- **Visualization**: Plot and inspect sample images that were classified correctly and incorrectly to understand model strengths and weaknesses.
- **Model Adjustment**: Based on the analysis results, adjust the model and retrain if necessary.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for building and training the model.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning libraries used to create, train, and evaluate the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and visual analysis of model performance.
- **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation metrics and utilities like confusion matrix and one-hot encoding.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to classify clothing items into multiple categories using image data. The model's performance can help retail companies enhance their inventory management, customer satisfaction, and marketing strategies. Future improvements may include experimenting with more advanced architectures, fine-tuning the hyperparameters, and using additional data augmentation techniques for better generalization.
